Sun will remain in Scorpio till 15 December 2020 that is for a period of one month. He is going to transit from an enemy sign to a friend&rsquo;s sign as Mars and Sun are thick friends. This gives general benefit to all the people. Let us see the implications of this transit according to the Lagnam (Ascendant) and Rasi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aries Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Lord of the Fifth House (House of Prosperity) Sun transiting to the Ashtamasthan (Eighth House - House of Death) reduces prosperity. Business gains will come down. Problems from children will crop up. Relations will break down. Lovers will become ex-lovers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taurus Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Lord of the Fourth House (House of Comforts) Sun transiting in the Seventh house (House of marriage and business) augurs well for married life, family comforts, personal life, business profits and peace of mind. Property deals will be successful. Real estate transactions will boom. You will buy new vehicles. However, transit Ketu in Scorpio can nullify all these things depending on other planets&rsquo; placements and aspects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gemini Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Lord of the Third House (House of Courage and Efforts) Sun transiting in the Sixth House (House of Health) has no special effects. Third house (House of courage and efforts) is half Dusthana (Bad Place) and Sixth House (House of Health) is fully a Dusthana (Bad Place). You will have no benefits here and the existing problems will continue. However, one new good thing is that you will get the courage and confidence to face any challenges. You will not be cowed down by the enemies. Whether you win or not, you will fight. Speech, communication skills and argument skill will develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cancer Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Lord of the Second House (House of Wealth, Family) Sun transiting in the Fifth house (House of prosperity) is excellent for wealth and prosperity. Financial gains will pour in. Business profit will increase. Promotions will come. Increments will be granted in the office. Foreign assignments will come. Married life will be happy. Family unity will increase. Peace of mind and happiness will set in. Relations will bloom. Ex-lovers will unite. Divorce petitions will be withdrawn. However, transit Ketu in Scorpio can nullify all these things depending on other planets&rsquo; placements and aspects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Leo Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Lagnatipati (Lord of the Ascendant) Sun transiting in the Fourth house (House of comforts) is beneficial for family unity, happiness, peace, comforts, luxuries and satisfaction. New property deals will come. You will buy new vehicles. New deals will be struck. New friendship will be developed. However, transit Ketu in Scorpio can nullify all these things depending on other planets&rsquo; placements and aspects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Virgo Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Lord of the Twelfth House (House of Losses) Sun transiting in the Third house (House of courage and efforts) does not benefit. Existing problems will continue. Confidence and courage will go down. Fear will grip the mind. Efforts will be in vain. Losses will come without announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Libra Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Lord of the Eleventh House (House of Gains) Sun transiting in the Second house (House of wealth and family) augurs well for the wealth and financial gains. New ventures will fetch reward. New friends will develop. Wishes will be fulfilled. Wealth will multiply. Family will be happy. Lovers will unite. Marriages will be fixed. However, transit Ketu in Scorpio can nullify all these things depending on other planets&rsquo; placements and aspects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scorpio Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Lord of the Tenth House (House of Profession) Sun transiting in the Lagnam (Ascendant) brings professional and career gains. Your efforts will be rewarded and appreciated in the office. Promotions will come. Increments will be granted. Foreign assignments will come. However, transit Ketu in Scorpio can nullify all these things depending on other planets&rsquo; placements and aspects. Sudden heart attack can happen in the next one month because of the association of Ketu and Sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sagittarius Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Lord of the Ninth House (House of Fortune) Sun transiting in the Twelfth house (House of losses) with Ketu is not good. Opportunities will be missed. Fortunes will be lost. Spirituality will increase. Foreign trips will be cancelled or prove to be unprofitable. Higher studies will be affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Capricorn Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Ashtamatipati (Lord of the Eighth House) Sun transiting in the Eleventh house (House of gains) does not augur well for financial gains. Friendship will break. Relations will break. Lovers will become ex-lovers. Wishes will not be fulfilled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aquarius Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Lord of the Seventh House (House of Marriage) Sun transiting in the Tenth house (House of profession) will be very good for business ventures. Profits will zoom. Expansion, modernization and diversification will occur in business houses. However, transit Ketu in Scorpio can nullify all these things depending on other planets&rsquo; placements and aspects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pisces Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi</strong>: Lord of the Sixth House (House of Health) Sun transiting in the Ninth house (House of fortune) can damage opportunities and wreck fortunes.

Those who have Cancer Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi and having a natal Sun in Scorpio gain a lot as they have a double Sun effect. Financial gains will be huge for them. Instead of Cancer Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi, if the Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi is Libra, then also the same benefit will come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who will be affected a lot? Those who have Capricorn Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi and have natal Sun or Ketu in Scorpio will be affected a lot as they will face a double Ketu or double Sun (this means a double Ashtamatipati (Lord of the Eighth House)) effect that will be too much for them to bear.</p>', '1', '2020-11-16 22:04:13.516512', '2020-11-17 11:53:38.628259'),

(20, 9366, '#', NULL, '<p><strong>Transit of Jupiter from Sagittarius to Capricorn on 20-11-2020</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of all the transits, Jupiter transit is the most looked for and most exciting. This is because the benefits or harm from the transit of minor planets are only for a short time &ndash; at the most one month or one and a half months. Among the major planets, Rahu and Ketu transits are feared because of the harm that they may do to the people. It is a question of less harm or more harm. Saturn transit is also dreaded as that can also produce harm. However, Jupiter transit generally favours the people. It is a question of more favours or less favours. More than the question of from which place to which place Jupiter transits, his aspects are very important. Jupiter has three aspects namely fifth aspect, straight seventh aspect and ninth aspect. These aspects can boost one&rsquo;s career, finances, business, marriage, health, family, personal life, courage, confidence, property acquisition, vehicle acquisition, comforts, luxuries, children&rsquo;s education, academics, higher studies, foreign settlement, foreign education, debt, court cases, long pending marriage, love relationships, spirituality, fortunes, opportunities, promotions, rewards in work place, fulfillment of wishes, friendship, minimizing losses, sex life, recovery from diseases and many such points. Jupiter will remain in Capricorn till November 21 2021. In between, he will come back to Sagittarius and then go again to Capricorn. The next one year period is very important for all the people in the world. Here, I have given my analysis of the benefits for each Lagnam (Ascendant) or Rasi for the next one year. As Jupiter has two Lordships, I have analyzed both. For good results, I have used blue text and for bad results I have used red text. If the result is neither good nor bad, I have used black text.

Sharp, harsh, and destructive planets function well in Kṛttikā - especially Mars and the Sun.4 These indicate high metabolism and excellent capacity to digest food and sources of inspiration. Saturn here suggests a blunt but effective critical outlook. Ketu indicates extremely strong metabolism and insight, in unsteady bursts. Rāhu is similar, being outspokenly critical as well. The soft planets (Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter) suggest inspiration and insight in arts, intelligence and law, but also suggest relationships challenges. The Moon in Kṛttikā suggests strong inspiration and motivation, but is not an ideal indicator for gentle affections and intimacies</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Characteristics As its symbol (the spear) indicates, natives of Krittika nakshatra are very direct, blunt and critical &ndash; especially if they fall in the earlier degrees, which come under the influence of two super-fiery planets &ndash; Sun and Mars. They can be very short-tempered, which is generally short-lived.&nbsp; Sun makes them noble-minded leaders who can take charge of any situation. The Sun also makes them spiritual and respectful of traditions. This nakshatra&rsquo;s deity is Agni, the God of Fire. These people can be very war-like and this is a nakshatra of sharp, cutting weapons. They don&rsquo;t mind getting into fights and disputes, and do not mince words in verbal duels with others. Krittika nakshatra also spans over Taurus where the soft Venus energy comes in. The fieriness is still there, but here is where the native becomes more artistic and is softer inside with a hard exterior shell. Taurus is the sign of the culinary arts and good food. So Krittika natives can be some of the most excellent cooks. Their desire for food can also make them gluttons. These people can be really sensual in the Taurus span of the nakshatra. Combined with their natural aggressiveness, they make excellent lovers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vishwanathan, Deepak. Secrets of Nakshatras (pp. 15-16). Unknown. Kindle Edition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following are the attributes of Krittika Nakshatra</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cleansing or cutting&nbsp; Fostering, encouraging&nbsp; Bravery&nbsp; Infidelity&nbsp; Cheating&nbsp; Impersonating&nbsp; Bravery&nbsp; Restoration of justice and goodness&nbsp; Intelligence&nbsp; Strong will power</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Kritika Nakshatra Kritika Nakshatra, Mesha Vrishabha Rashi, Characteristics, and four Pada: Kritika Nakshatra first Pada falls in Aries but three padas fall in Taurus sign ruled by Venus. Kritika in general means flame or the one who cuts. Its symbol is axe or a burning flame. Other sharp cutting instruments that easily penetrate like blade, surgical operation blade, knife etc. also come under this Nakshatra. But this cutting element will relate more in Aries sign. When we shift to Taurus this Nakshatra indicates Lord Kartika, son of Lord Shiva. As Lord Kartik was looked after many mothers before reaching to his actual mother, Goddess Maa Paravati; this Nakshatra indicates extra care during childhood through many mother-like females. Normally, when a child is born, he is looked after by his mother. But in this case, the child was looked by many mother-like women at hidden and secretive place. After Lord Kartika grew old, he was appointed as the commander of the force of Deva (Indra). He killed the demons and gave relief to Lord Indra. Due to very high piercing capacity, Kritika born natives have piercing intellect. But as the lord of this Nakshatra is Sun, natives are straightforward and bold. They consider themselves &ldquo;always right&rdquo; and tend to criticize others, though have no malefic intentions about anybody. They normally fail to move according to situation and may face troubles or failures. All people born with lagna lord with Sun are of similar nature. They may be over loyal to the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>society, the organization they work or seniors etc which finally gives miseries and downfall for them. So if we see Saturn posited in this Nakshatra, we can expect the worse results especially if it is in first part; meaning in debilitation. People born in Kritika Nakshatra though will give utmost care and love to others as the deity is Lord Kartika but they are practical and hard at the same time. It&rsquo;s a Rakshasa and female Nakshatra. It has downward aspect. Physical features: Male is solidly built body with big shoulders and developed muscles. He has a commanding appearance. Female has extremely beautiful body, medium height. Character: Male does not like to achieve name, fame and wealth through unfair means or at the mercy of others. His need is less and does not believe in age-old blind belief and customs. He does public work but looses and fails. Frustrations lead him to outburst. Female will not subdue to the pressure of others. Therefore, she has to suffer mentally. She is fond of quarrels. She expresses arrogance not only in her appearance but also in the domestic environment. Education, source of earning/ profession: Male will earn his livelihood in the foreign land or away from the place of birth. Partnership business is not suitable to him. In case he is interested in business, he can derive maximum benefits from the yarn export, medicines and decorative industries. Female is not highly educated. She earns by working in the paddy field, agriculture field, fisheries and other small-scale industries. She also earns as a musician, artist, tailor or leather products manufacturer. Family life: Male is lucky in his Love marriage with a faithful and virtuous wife. The health of the spouse will be a concern for him and he may have to quite often live separately due to work or due to ill health of the spouse. He is more attached to</p>\r\n\r\n<p>mother and will enjoy more favour and love from the mother. His father will be a pious man and well-known person; he cannot enjoy comforts and benefits from father. The period between 25 to 35 years and 50 to 56 years will be very good. Female cannot enjoy full comforts of her husband. In some cases childlessness or separation from husband or no marriage is indicated. She will not keep cordial relation with relatives. She lives in an illusion world and she shows discourtesy to the people who actually are her well wishes. Health: Male is prone to dental problem, weak eyesight, tuberculosis, wind and piles, brain fever, accident, wounds, malaria or cerebral meningitis. Female health will be severely afflicted either due to excess work or lack of mental peace. Glandular tuberculosis has also been noticed. Positive traits: They have honesty, frankness and respect of people around, protective ability, and are extremely hard working. Negative traits: They have tendency of fault finding, anger, lack of diplomacy and are centre of negative criticism on account of their bluntness. Professions &amp; Career: He prospers as administrators, leaders, lawyers and excels in career away from their home land. The partnership will never be his cup of tea, but can excel in business related to yarn, artistic goods and medicines, engineering and draftsman ship. Kritika Natives Professions &amp; Career are soldiers, warriors, leaders, spiritual teachers, policemen, head of orphanage, cr&egrave;che owners, maid</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muhurata: It&rsquo;s good for all activities requiring leadership, initiative, motivation, aggression, war, crime control, motherhood, taking strong decisions like giving up addictions etc. It should be avoided in swimming or any water sports activity. Kritika Nakshatra and its four Pada: 1st (first) Pada of Kritika Nakshatra: The natives are spiritually developed, moral and generous in nature. They have extraordinary will power and intellect. They enjoy high status in their family and social circle and are very hard to win over. The natives are generally tall. Natives born in first Pada are generally tall, slim, and talkative with horse like head and having eye-brows meeting each other at centre. Krittika Nakshatra 1st Pada name&rsquo;s first letter is &quot;aa&quot;. 2nd (second) Pada of Krittika Nakshatra: It makes the person materialist. The natives born in this Pada have slightly dark complexion. Their eyes normally look indifferent from each other especially while talking. Kritika Nakshatra 2nd Pada names first letter is &quot;e&quot;. 3rd (third) Pada of Kritika Nakshatra: These natives are idealistic and sincere to their responsibility. They give quite lazy outward appearance body parts slightly bent forward. They give very mature look by their eyes.

Serpa Shaap( Naga Dosha) : This results in miscarriage in women, or fear of child death or other problems like delay in child birth which occurs in both charts of&nbsp; males or females.<br />\r\na. It forms when Rahu is placed in the fifth house either in Aries or Scorpio sign.<br />\r\nb. This inauspicious yoga also occurs even if Mars has drusti on Rahu placed in 5th house.<br />\r\nc.&nbsp;When Shani making combi with Moon in the house or evenif moon has drusti on Shani placed in 5th house.d.&nbsp; Karak for Child birth is Jupiter, if it is placed with Rahu in 5th house and Mars in lagna, then also this yoga occurs.<br />\r\ne. When Rahu is placed in lagna and Mars and Jupiter combo in present in chart and 5th house house lord is present either 6/8/12, then too this bad yoga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remedy for this bad yoga is Nag pujan with mantra shanti by placing Nag idol made in gold. Donating cow, land, sesame, gold to Brahmin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The causative planet should be identified by any learned Astrologer and then Nagbali pujan is done to rectify this yoga. One more remedy is also very effective, doing fast on Five Panchi ( as per Hindu) tithi for consecutive five Panchmi vrat. In,this five naga idol are made by hand with wheat flour and termeric powder and offering flowers, prasad, rice lahi, and then offering&nbsp;this&nbsp;pujan on next day to river or any no man&#39;s land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2 Pisacha Badha/ Pida:<br />\r\na. When Rahu or Ketu are placed in 7th house or Rahu with Moon in lagna and 5th or 9th house occupied with malefic Shani and Mars this inauspicious yoga is is known to occur.<br />\r\nb. Lagna occupied with Rahu+ Shani then also this yoga occurs. Ketu occupied with any malefic planet or is seen by malefic planet, then also this yoga is found in main chart.<br />\r\nc. Shani is placed with weak/debilitating moon in 8th house this badha is subject to occur. This yoga results hard suffering life to the jatak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best Remedy for this is Narayan and Nag Bali pujan at the banks of the river with Shiva Temple or Nashik, Ujjain or Gayaji.<br />\r\nThe best month for this shanti pujan is Shravana/ Bhadrapada/ mahashivratri day/ nagpanchami day/ sankranti/ trayodashi as well as panchami tithi of any month out of the 12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remaining yogas will be discussed in my next article.

I have drawn the gist of this article from the original text through the reference of a Marathi book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Bruhad Parashar Hora Shatram, the aadhyay based on &quot; Purvajanma Shaapdyotak Aadhyay&quot; covers Serpa Shaap( Naga Dosha), Pitru Dosha, Anapatya Yoga, Pret Badha, Pishachya Badha and Abhichar Yoga are in very precise and easy manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C. PITRU SHAAP&nbsp;: It mainly occurs in,the chart due to debilitating Sun in 5th or 9th house. This yoga become more worst if Sun in this house placed with malefic planets in 1st and 12th houses of debilitating Sun. This may result in loss of progeny or delay child birth or reduced longevity of one&#39;s child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. If the ascendant occupied with malefic planet this result will be certain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. There will be no child if there will any connection between 10th Mars and 5th lord and malefic planets present in ascendant, 5th and 10th houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. If Sun is placed in 8th house, 5th house occupied with Saturn and ascendant with malefic planet, then there will be no yoga for child in person&#39;s life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. If the 5th house is occupied with 6th and 10th house lord and Guru placed with Rahu in any of the houses, there will be lots of chances of loss of progeny ( before and after the birth). As per the Bruhad Parashar Hora Shashtram&#39;, Narayan Bali Nag Bali pujan is must with &#39; Gaya Shraddha&#39;. Gaya Shraddha is also done in Trambkeshwar near Nashik called as &#39; Rudra Gaya&#39;. Ujjain ( M.P) is also the other auspicious placed to solve this inauspicious pujan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D. PRET SHAAP: In this inauspicious yoga, the karmas of past ancestors get nullified due to their incomplete last time recit. This results in difficulty and obstacles in persons current life and ahead.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. This results due to Sun- Saturn combo in 5th or 9th house specially with weak Moon in 7th house and Guru-Rahu Chandal Yoga in any of the houses in the chart.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. 5th house lord Shani placed in 8th house, ascendant is occupied with Mars and 8th house with Guru.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Ascendant with Rahu,Venus, and Guru and 8th house occupied with Shani and Moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Rahu in lagna and Shani with Mars or suspected by Mars causes the loss of progeny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. 8th house with Shani Venus and Guru too causes this bad yoga. As per the Bruhad Parashar Hora Shashtram&#39;, Narayan Bali Nag Bali pujan, Vishnu Shraddha, donating Brahma idol to Brahmin after Rudrabhishek.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E. ANAPATYA YOGA ( No Child Birth) As per Bhagwat Gita - Dyaiva Chaivatra Panchmam&#39; means there is no option available for These Shaap Pida obtained due to the past lives karma of a person. King Dasharath is the best example of this Dosha. He obtained the pleasures of Four children but specially Lord Rama, but also got the seperation from his beloved Rama at the time of his death bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. This occurs when 5th, 2nd, and 7th lord get connected anyhow by yoga or aspects of malefic in Navamash chart.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Lord of ascendant when placed in 8th house, 5th house lord when afflicted with malefic planets and Guru in debilitating state specially in Shashtiamsha Chart.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Weak Guru, ascendant lord 7th and 5th house lord also results in,this inauspicious yoga.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. 5th house occupied with debilitating malefic planets and ascendant as well as 5th lord may be present in either 6th or 8th or 12th house. Karak planet Guru should also be in debilitating state. As per the Bruhad Parashar Hora Shashtram&#39;, Narayan Bali Nag Bali pujan can be the remedy for this yoga.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F. ABHICHAR YOG: Obstacle in the child birth is also due to this bad yoga.Person doesn&#39;t get the child in life or if got then faces a lots of trouble.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. This happened when Acendant is occupied with either any of the sign of Aries, Cancer, Libra or Capricorn and ascendant is expected by lord of the 6th house lord.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. 11th house Mars results in Abhichar Yoga.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. 9th house is occupied with any of the sign out of Taurus, Leo, Scorpio or Aquarius whereas, 7th house should be occupied with Gemini, Vergo, Sagittarius or Pisces As per the Bruhad Parashar Hora Shashtram&#39;, Narayan Bali Nag Bali pujan and Tripindi Shraddha. Now it can be done at Trambkeshwar near Nashik.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Best Period for these remedies are Bhadrapada Krusha Paksha ( Pitru Paksha) or Pousha Month as per the Hindu Calender.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Article Submitted by :: Acharya&nbsp;Bhushan Ratnakar.</p>', '0', '2020-12-22 14:19:43.349709', '2020-12-22 14:19:43.349709'),

In this article, I&#39;m trying to illustrate the two most commonly occurring inauspicious yogas out of the above mentioned &nbsp;six well- known inauspicious yogas in jakak&#39;s chart.&nbsp;<br />\r\nFor this, I have drawn the gist of this text from the primary text through the reference of a Marathi book.&nbsp;<br />\r\n1. Serpa-Shaap( Naga-Dosha) : This inauspicious yoga leads to miscarriage in women, or fear Of child death or other problems like delay in child birth which occurs in both charts of males or females. a. It forms when Rahu is placed within the fifth house either in Aries or Scorpio sign. b. This inauspicious yoga also occurs albeit Mars has drusti on Rahu placed in 5th house. c. When Shani making combi with Moon within the house or evenif moon has drusti on Shani placed in 5th house.d. Karak for Child birth is Jupiter, if it&#39;s placed with Rahu in 5th house and Mars in lagna, then also this yoga occurs. e. When malefic Rahu planet is placed in lagna and Mars and Jupiter combo in present in chart and 5th house house lord is present either 6/8/12, then too this bad yoga. For the removal of this bad yoga is Nag pujan with mantra shanti by placing Nag idol made in gold. Donating cow, land, sesame, gold to Brahmin. However the root or the causative planet should be identified by any learned Astrologer then Nagbali pujan is completed to rectify this yoga. One additional but very effective remedy for this is doing fast on Five Panchi ( as per Hindu) tithi for consecutive five Panchmi vrat. In this pujan, &nbsp;five naga idol are made by hand with flour and termeric powder, some milk with water and offering flowers, prasad, rice lahi, then offering this pujan on the very next day in river or any no man&#39;s land under any alone tree.&nbsp;<br />\r\n2 Pisacha Badha/ Pida: a. When malefic planets like Rahu or Ketu are placed in 7th house or Rahu with Moon in lagna and 5th or 9th house occupied with malefic Shani and Mars this inauspicious yoga this is understood to occur. b. In the main chart, the first house when is occupied with Rahu with Shani then also this yoga occurs. In the jatak&#39;s chart, if Ketu occupied with any malefic planet or is seen by malefic planet, then also this yoga is found. c. If natural malefic Shani is placed with malefic/debilitating moon in 8th house this badha is subjected to occur. This yoga worsely results hard suffering life to the jatak. The most effective shanti pujan for the removal of this is Narayan and Nag Bali pujan at the banks of the river with Shiva Temple or Nashik, Ujjain or Gayaji. The auspicious months for this shanti pujan is Shravana/ Bhadrapada/ mahashivratri day/ nagpanchami day/ sankranti/ trayodashi also as panchami tithi of any month out of the 12 months. Remaining yogas are getting to be discussed in my next article. Thanks expecting you feedback eagerly.

The person has to gain control over his arrogance to get success. In case the number is positive, this person will be capable of making friends from any base number category. However, in the case of a negative number, making friends for this person will be a huge challenge. Parents are advised to be calm with the child under this Moolank category.<br />\r\nMoolank 2:<br />\r\nA person having this Moolank is likely to be emotional, introvert &amp; inclined towards art. Also, such a person is advised to make friends with similar interests &amp; nature. The adverse effect of this characteristic makes them weak in judgment owing to their excessive emotions. These people need to have trustworthy people in their surroundings to make a sound &amp; balanced decision. These people have strong debating abilities.<br />\r\nMoolank 3:<br />\r\nA person with this base number on the correct path will lead to being an ambitious, knowledgeable, strong-willed &amp; positive individual. These people will always be determined to follow their desire. In case they meet with the right kind of opportunity, they have the ability to become Guru in their lifetime. On the other hand, if this person has a negative number than he would be excessively ambitious &amp; egoistic.<br />\r\nMoolank 4 :<br />\r\nPeople from this category have in-depth knowledge of their subject of interest. These people are outstanding in their studies &amp; also keep searching for ways to help the community. Owing to this characteristic they can be good professors, scientists &amp; researchers. Under the guidance of a competent mentor, they can accomplish greater heights in life. Though these people are spiritual but always experience a dilemma between spirituality &amp; materialism.<br />\r\nMoolank 5:<br />\r\nThese people are quite sharp in their thoughts. They have the capability to understand the hidden meaning of things &amp; that too very quickly. A person from this base number would have many friends. Parents of the kids from this category should not be spoiled &amp; need to be taught to share &amp; care. These people are likely to be distant from their home &amp; family in an emotional manner.<br />\r\nMoolank 6:<br />\r\nSuch people are mostly artistic, logical &amp; full of emotions. They generally have a balanced nature, which helps them to accomplish success. In very scarce situations their emotions lead them to issues in life. These people need to be guided towards ethical living in childhood. These people can do well as artists &amp; also in government jobs.<br />\r\nMoolank 7:<br />\r\nPeople who have number 7 as Moolank are likely to be very emotional &amp; intelligent. However, getting success in its capacity is quite difficult. They need continuous support from Guru, Parents &amp; Friends. In case, this number is negative then these people end up being lazy &amp; fearful of taking the initiative.<br />\r\nMoolank 8:<br />\r\nMoolank 8 is for very practical &amp; hard-working people. Under the circumstances where this number is positive, a person will do his work with utmost honesty &amp; will gain great success. On the other hand, if this is a negative number; this person will incline towards finding shortcuts to get success &amp; face failures.

These people are most willing to help others. Their involvement in any work they do is deeper. They attempt to become a perfectionist in any task they take up for a longer span of time.

This is probably the first article that deals with Vastu&rsquo;s influence on relationships. The present-day Vastu experts continue to deal with the effects of inanimate objects on the occupants of a house or workplace but fail to explore their influence on relationships between the members occupying the house in any detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We, being social animals, interact with one another at all times throughout our lives. From birth to death, our success or failure is measured by the kind of relationship we have had with others.We nurture friendships, indulge in romances, consolidate work and school-related connection, strengthen family ties,and quite often , get involved in relationships that defy categorization! Relationship are central to our existence, et none is simple or can be taken for granted. If cultivated properly, they have the potentioal to enrich us, adding to our feelings of self-worth , enjoyment and growth. On the other hand, there are relationships that may make us uncomfortable. Family not treating us properly, spouse cheating on us, chidren getting out of hand, lovers being dishonest, colleagues back-stabbing, elders not getting the respect they deserve and the like. Remember that in all kinds of kinships, there is bound to be some disagreement, need for compromise and times frustration, but they don&rsquo;t necessarily make a relationship unhealthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through my years devoted to solving people&rsquo;s problems through Astrology, I have found unhappiness afflicting a majority of households, mostly resulting from strained inter-personal relationships between family members. This friction, occurring between mothers and daughters-in &ndash;law, amongst brothers, between teenage children and their parents or between others, if left unattended, generally becomes a sure shot recipe for desaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to Astrology, Vastu Shastra, the ancient treatise on architecture,is another powerful science that emphasizes ways to attain happiness by components within. It has a wealth of information on the enhancement of human relationships. I have studied it in detail and am surprised to find that the principles and techniques available in this treatise can be employed to the restoration and cultivation of relationships too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I commence with the remedial measures for, say, health problems afflicting a household, my first step is to find out the interpersonal equation within the house or are there some tensions?

It is like we are in a school where we have to pass the exams. Once you pass the exam of the highest class you will eventually merge in the pure energy of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now consider each lifetime as a class where you have to learn certain lessons and pass the exam. The difference is that you don&rsquo;t have a syllabus and you don&rsquo;t even know what you have to learn. In this class, all the tests which happen are surprise tests. Some are comparably easy and others tough but are sure to happen. If we don&rsquo;t pass the exam of this lifetime class then we have to come again and send one more lifetime for learning the same lessons and give similar tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, here comes free will. What and how much we learn and grow in this lifetime is our own hands. If we learn our lesson consciously then tests will still appear periodically but it will be easy for us to clear it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am quoting lines of Yogananda from his book &lsquo;Autobiography of a Yogi &lsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A child is born on that day and at that hour when the celestial rays are in mathematical harmony with his individual karma. His Horoscope is a challenging portrait, revealing his unalterable past and its probable future results. But the natal chart can be rightly interpreted only by men of intuitive wisdom. Occasionally, I told astrologers to select my worst periods, according to planetary indications, and I would still accomplish whatever task set for myself. It is true that my success at such times has been accompanied by extraordinary difficulties but faith in divine protection and conscious effort from one&rsquo;s side are forces formidable beyond any other&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our birth chart clearly indicates the area where we have to learn lessons. If we learn those lessons beforehand through spiritual practices or behavioural patterns, we might attract less intensity of events because our learning is already complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Astrology should be utilized to guide one with ways to deal with karma and ultimately rising above it, Like in the case of a storm, all the birds seek shelter but eagles avoid the storm by flying above it. Similarly, we can make ourselves capable to rise above the storms of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Long as we take birth in physical form, the law of karma will affect us in one way or another and it would be useful if we could achieve an understanding of the karmic pattern to be deal with in this lifetime if no other reason than that it would enable us to face our destiny with grace and acceptance and will not come as a surprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '1', '2021-08-06 20:20:11.996796', '2021-08-08 11:45:56.427786'),
